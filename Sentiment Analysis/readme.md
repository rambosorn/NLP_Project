# Sentiment Analysis
Project Inspired by **Prof.Chaky** and fully support from our TA **Amanda**.
- Prof.github: https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/Python-for-NLP
### This sentiment Analysis test with NLTK library dataset and run on localhost with flask.
1. Dataset recommend by Prof.Chaky: https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html
2. Check out officail page for ntlk data library: https://www.nltk.org/index.html

##### Note: 
- In sentiment analysis, the "neutral" score typically indicates that the text being analyzed is neither positive nor negative, but rather, it is neutral or without sentiment. The "compound" score is a single score that represents the overall sentiment of the text, calculated by taking the sum of all the lexicon ratings which have been normalized between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).
- The rating by 5 is a common practice when using a rating scale from 0 to 5, as it allows you to convert the rating to a percentage value, where 0 corresponds to 0% and 5 corresponds to 100%.

## Future work I paln to test Sentiment analysis on Facebook API for my own facebook page
** Environment Septup **
1. access to the Facebook API, you need to create a Facebook Developer account
2. access to the Graph API, you can use it to collect data for sentiment analysis
3. Preprocess Data Python libraries like NLTK, Spacy
4. Feature Extraction
5. Training a Model
6. Evaluation
### Delpoy this project test in local host using flask
