# Story Generator using Tranformer
Project Inspired by **Prof.Chaky** and fully support from our TA **Amanda**.
- Prof.github: https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/Python-for-NLP

## Environment Setup
1. Install the required libraries: pip flask and step the directory
2. Singup for Open to API Key https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
3. Generate stories using the OpenAI GPT-3 language model
4. Create Flask project to run on your local machine

However, there are also some limitations to this project. Here are some of the limitations:
- API limits: To use the GPT-3 model, you will need to have an API key, which comes with certain usage limits. You may not be able to generate an unlimited number of stories without hitting these limits.
- Quality of generated stories: While GPT-3 is one of the most advanced language models available, it is not perfect. The generated stories may contain errors, inconsistencies, or other issues that make them less than ideal for some use cases.
- Training and computational requirements: While you don't need to train the GPT-3 model yourself, you will need a powerful computer or access to cloud computing resources to generate stories in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, generating high-quality stories may require many API calls, which can be computationally expensive.
