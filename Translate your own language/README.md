# Story Generator using Tranformer
Project Inspired by **Prof.Chaky** and fully support from our TA **Amanda**.
- Prof.github: https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/Python-for-NLP

## Environment Setup
1. Install the required libraries: pip flask and step the directory
2. Singup for Open to API Key https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
3. Generate stories using the OpenAI GPT-3 language model
4. Create Flask project to run on your local machine

- GPT-3 has not been specifically trained for Khmer language machine translation, so its performance in that domain would likely be limited. The Khmer language has unique characteristics that may require specific training data and language models to accurately translate text.
- Hugging Face provides access to many pre-trained transformer models, including those that can be used for machine translation. However, the quality of machine translation models from Hugging Face for Khmer language specifically may vary depending on the training data and the architecture of the models.
