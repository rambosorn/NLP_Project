# Machine Translation KH-EN
Project Inspired by **Prof.Chaky** and fully support from our TA **Amanda**.
- Prof.github: https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/Python-for-NLP

## Preparation
1. Collect a large corpus of Khmer language data
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Build and train a machine translation model
4. Evaluate and refine your model
5. Deploy and integrate your model

## Implement this project I have tried with several pre-tain models
- OpenAI GPT-3 language model
- Hugging face Pre-train model

- GPT-3 has not been specifically trained for Khmer language machine translation, so its performance in that domain would likely be limited. The Khmer language has unique characteristics that may require specific training data and language models to accurately translate text.
- Hugging Face provides access to many pre-trained transformer models, including those that can be used for machine translation. However, the quality of machine translation models from Hugging Face for Khmer language specifically may vary depending on the training data and the architecture of the models.
