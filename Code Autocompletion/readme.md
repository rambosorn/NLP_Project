I have tried with code parrot by hugging face build on top of GPT-2. The Code Parrot dataset is already preprocessed and split into training and validation sets, and the GPT-2 language model is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. However the generat suggestion result seem not accurate. It might due for some reason: This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the model not being trained on enough data, or the input code being too complex for the model to accurately predict the next few lines.
