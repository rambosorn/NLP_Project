# Story Generator using Hugging face
Project Inspired by **Prof.Chaky** and fully support from our TA **Amanda**.
- Prof.github: https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/Python-for-NLP

## Environment Setup
1. Install required libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries, including Flask and the Hugging Face Transformers library.
2. Load the language model: Load the pre-trained language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
3. Set up Flask app: Create a new Flask app and define routes for the home page and the story generation page.
5. Create HTML templates: Create HTML templates for the home page and the result page.
6. Implement story generation logic: Implement the story generation logic in the Flask app's route function for the story generation page. Use the pre-trained language model to generate a story based on the user's input.
7. Deploy the app: Deploy the Flask app to a web server or run it locally.

Overall, the limitations of using Hugging Face for story generation include the need for significant computational resources, potential data bias, the need for expertise in fine-tuning the model, limited interpretability, and limited creativity.
